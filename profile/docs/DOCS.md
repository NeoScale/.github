# About us

My [friend](https://www.github.com/advancedantiskid) and [I](https://www.github.com/silkyfalcon) over the years have started to get annoyed that a lot of discord servers have at least 5 bots on them, each with a different function. We had the idea, since we've been developing for years, why not start our own bot to replace the functions of several bots. So this is where our story begins.

We have a long-standing dream to break into the foreign market with an innovative idea, and we think this could be a good choice to spread our visibility.
